            <h2><img src="./assets/about-icon.png" alt="about-icon">About CRAFTSVILLA</h2>
            <p> At Craftsvilla, we believe that creativity isn’t just an activity — it’s a way of life.
                We exist to remind people that in a world that moves too fast, sometimes all you need is a brush, a palette, and a moment to breathe.
                Founded on the simple idea that togetherness sparks inspiration, Craftsvilla has become more than an art space — it’s a community. A sanctuary. A place where laughter, color, and connection come to life through every brushstroke and mosaic tile.
                Whether it’s parents discovering new ways to bond with their children, friends exploring unfamiliar creative corners, or coworkers escaping the digital noise to reconnect with something real — Craftsvilla welcomes everyone.
                Our guided workshops are not about making perfect art. They’re about making meaningful memories. We believe in messy moments, spontaneous laughter, and the quiet satisfaction of creating something with your own hands.
                Because here, it’s not about talent — it’s about togetherness.
                It’s not about results — it’s about reconnection.
                And it’s not about art — it’s about heart.
                So pick up a brush. Take a deep breath.
                And let your creativity flow — because at Craftsvilla, we’re not just making art…
                We’re creating joy. One color at a time.</p>

            <h2><img src="./assets/mission-icon.png" alt="mission-icon">Our mission</h2>
            <p> At Craftsvilla, our mission is simple — yet profoundly transformative.
                We exist to reconnect humanity through creativity.
                In a world overflowing with screens, stress, and spreadsheets, we offer something timeless: the opportunity to rediscover yourself through art.
                Every brushstroke. Every shared laugh. Every imperfect masterpiece.
                They’re not just moments — they’re connections.
                Because when people create together, something truly magical happens: they remember what it feels like to be human.
                We don’t just teach art.
                We nurture emotion.
                We spark joy.
                We build communities, one canvas at a time.</p>

            <h2><img src="./assets/values-icon.png" alt="values-icon">Our core values</h2>
            <p> 1. Connection Over Perfection
                We celebrate the messy, the colorful, and the wonderfully human.
                Art isn’t about precision — it’s about presence. <br>
                2. Creativity Without Judgment
                Whether you’ve painted for decades or just discovered what a paintbrush is, you belong here.
                Because creativity doesn’t discriminate — and neither do we. <br>
                3. Togetherness is the Medium
                At Craftsvilla, our greatest masterpiece isn’t what hangs on the wall — it’s the friendships, laughter, and shared memories made along the way. <br>
                4. Relaxation is an Art Form
                We believe self-care should feel like watercolor on paper — gentle, soothing, and unapologetically personal. <br>
                5. Joy, Bottled in Color
                From deep greens of calm to bright yellows of laughter, every shade tells a story.
                We’re here to make sure yours shines brightest.
